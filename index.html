	ABOUT THE CREATOR 
	REMEMBER INDY THE LABEL? This is her now. Feel old yet?

<p>I felt anxious about the change. You guys and your opinions are truly the only ones I really care about. So I wondered how you’d react. I mean it is a little nerve-wracking. Like introducing your kids to a new boyfriend. But this boyfriend is like way hotter with tattoos and stuff.

So why the change?  I came across a picture of a ghost with the word ‘LONELY’ scrawled across the bottom. Ghosts have kind of taken over my life since we launched the brand, so I naturally screenshot any ghosty Inspo, and this one was cool. It had a cool vibe.

I couldn’t get it out of my head. “Lonely Ghost.” It just sounded cool. I started scribbling in my sketchbook, “lonely ghost” on some poorly drawn sweatpants, and my heart started racing. I couldn’t wait to get back to the states and show Bronson my idea. “The Lonely Ghost Collection.”

Weeks later, that day came and he was stoked. He loved it, just like I did. We sat there on our computers, and about 5 minutes later he says out loud,

“Huh. That domain is available.”

I was like, “What domain?” “Lonely Ghost”
And boyyyy when I tell you a physical embodiment of a real-life lightbulb appeared above my head and flashed brighter than the sun… you won’t believe me.  But it happened. I’m pretty sure.

We gotta change the name. NOW, LONELY GHOST CAME TO BE. </p>
